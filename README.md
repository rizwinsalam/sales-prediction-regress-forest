The dataset contains various features such as item weight, visibility, maximum retail price (MRP), outlet establishment year, and outlet size, among others. 

The project workflow involves:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values by imputing mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the distribution and relationships among different variables.

2. Model Building:
    - **Linear Regression**: Utilized to establish a linear relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (sales).
    - **Random Forest**: Employed for more complex relationships and to capture non-linear patterns within the data.

3. Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess the accuracy and goodness-of-fit of the models.

4. Visualization: Visual representations such as scatter plots and histograms are generated to visualize the actual versus predicted sales values and explore the distribution of variables.

This project aims to provide insights into sales trends and patterns, facilitating better decision-making processes for businesses in the retail sector.
